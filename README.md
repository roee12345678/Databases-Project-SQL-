# Databases Project - SQL

## About
This project is part of the "Databases" course in my degree, where I applied extensive SQL knowledge. Together with my team from class, we built a database for a cosmetic salon that contains information about customers, treatments, and more. During the project, we analyzed the database using several SQL queries we created.

The project includes the following four files:
* **Presentation slides** – A presentation explaining the project (in Hebrew).
* **Queries** – A file containing the SQL queries.
* **Salon_consultation** – The SQL file to be run in a SQL environment (e.g., cPanel, SQL Server, etc.).
* **Table structures and details** – A file outlining the database building process.

## How to Run
1. Open cPanel and select the "Import" option in the toolbar.
2. Choose the file: *Salon_consultation* and upload it.
3. Now, you can view the entire database with the tables and run the queries.
